Carl Sagan famously said *When you're in love, you want to tell the world*. Below are the list of things that I love and find exciting. I have always wanted to share these with people and talk about them.

## Blogs/Essays

- [The days are long but the decades are short](https://blog.samaltman.com/the-days-are-long-but-the-decades-are-short): A blog by Sam Altman containing some amazing points. My favourite one is *Regret is the worst, and most people regret far more things they didn’t do than things they did do*
- [Mathematician Rota's 12 Life Lessons:](https://fs.blog/2021/02/gian-carlo-rota/) The importance of a lecture being not longer than a microcentury, Hilbert's story that tells you not to worry about small mistakes.
- [Adding is favoured over subtracting in problem solving](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00592-0): People always think that only adding elements will solve the current problem. Its implications - we think we always need to do more. Cutting down things helps most of the time. More on [Cal Newport's blog](https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2021/05/06/the-neuroscience-of-busyness/). Similar blog on [Farnam Street.](https://fs.blog/2021/05/slack/)

## Letters

- [Don't Remain Nameless by Richard Feynman](https://fs.blog/2014/08/richard-feynman-what-problems-to-solve/): My all time favourite letter. 

  - *No problem is too small or trivial if we can really do something about it*

  - *Do not remain nameless to yourself – it is too sad a way to be. Know your place in the world and evaluate yourself fairly, not in terms of your naive ideals of your own youth*

- [Abraham Lincoln's letter to his son's teacher:](https://englishbookgeorgia.com/blogebg/a-letter-from-abraham-lincoln-to-his-sons-teacher/)
  - *Teach him to have faith in his own ideas, even if every one tell him they are wrong.*
  - *Teach him that for every enemy, there is a friend. He will have to know that all men are not just, that all men are not true. But teach him also that for every scoundrel there is a hero, that for every crooked politician, there is a dedicated leader.*

## Talks

- [Guido's talk about his life and Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgtL4S7Hrwo): An inspiring story, the ending was heart touching!
- [Simplicity Matters by Rich Hickey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rI8tNMsozo0): A talk about simplicity and its importance. 
- [Hammock Driven Development by Rich Hickey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f84n5oFoZBc): I liked the part when he spoke about how sometimes our brain works on problem in the background, even though we are not consciously working on it. When you are stuck on a problem, give a break! [Poincare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Poincar%C3%A9#Toulouse's_characterisation) believed the same.
- [Keynote by K Lars Lohn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSfe5M_zG2s): The story telling is amazing. Its a heart touching story. This talk inspired me to read GEB. Reading GEB was an amazing journey!

## Documentaries

- [The Internet's Own Boy: The Story of Aaron Swartz](https://youtu.be/9vz06QO3UkQ) : Story about inspiring life of Aaron Swartz. I highly recommend you to watch this documentary. I have summarised some of  Aaron's blogs on [my blog](https://rakaar.github.io/posts/2021-06-11-aaronblogs/).

## People

- [Aaron Swartz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz): Young hacktivist who deeply understood about Open knowledge, Education system and web. I recommend you to watch [this documentary](https://youtu.be/9vz06QO3UkQ) about Aaron. Aaron's blogs are collected in a book by name - The Boy Who Could Change the World. You can read my summary of selected blogs [here](https://rakaar.github.io/posts/2021-06-11-aaronblogs/).

  > Be curious. Read widely. Try new things. I think a lot of what people call intelligence just boils down to curiosity.

- [Richard Stallman](https://stallman.org/): Leaving your stable day job to start something new and revolutionary about what you believe in is really inspiring about RMS!
